# CSD121 Developer Journal

This `README.md` file is the start of your developer journal. Use it to help you take lecture notes, plan, think, and remember important information that you encounter in CSD121.

Read [this article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/12/24/you-should-keep-a-developer-s-journal/) to get a sense of what a developer journal is and how to use one.

You may put your whole developer journal in this one file, or split it into multiple files/folders, but keep it all in this repository as a set of Markdown files. For information on how to format the text in a Markdown file, read [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

> **NOTE**: You may NOT use AI tools to generate your journal entries.  Doing so defeats the purpose of a developer journal.
