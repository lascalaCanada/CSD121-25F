01. Hello chat, I need your help to achieve some requests in a Lab from my College. 
    Please could you validate for me if I want to create an array in Java (JDK 25) with two diff positions; should I use [ ][ ] to declare the array? 
    Just an additional information, inside brackets ([ ]), I intent to use variables to adjust values.

02. This array is char type, the declaration I'm using is "private final char[][] grid = new char[3][3]
    Does it make sense?

03. Chat, the use of "!" character before a conditional, inquiries in the opposite form?

04. chat, what does the command String.valueOf(input.charAt(0)) do? 
    I'm using this declaration: String[]

05. I’m trying to use a switch statement with an enum; should I use the enum name directly or call a method to get its value?

06. Can I use a public enum to represent the rows and columns of a board in Java, or should I use a class instead?

07. chat, can I use char type to store symbols like 'X' and 'O', or is it better to use String for that?

08. chat, is it correct to use final when I want to make sure a variable like a player name or symbol doesn’t change during the game?
    I found this term in a search on google.com

09. Can I use a method that returns a formatted string instead of printing directly inside the method? 
    I want to keep the logic separate.

10. chat, is it okay to use a loop to build a string with multiple lines, or should I use StringBuilder for better performance?

11. I’m using a method to check if the board is full; should I return a boolean or use another approach to indicate a draw?

12. Can I use a ternary operator to switch between two players in a single line? 
    I want to keep the code short.

13. chat, can I use a static method inside an enum to convert a number or string into a specific enum value?
